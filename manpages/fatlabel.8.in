.TH FATLABEL 8 2017\-10\-01 "dosfstools @PACKAGE_VERSION@"
.SH NAME
fatlabel \- set or get MS\-DOS filesystem label or volume ID
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfatlabel\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIDEVICE\fR [\fINEW\fR]
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfatlabel\fR will display or change the volume label or volume ID on the
MS\-DOS filesystem located on \fIDEVICE\fR.
By default it works in label mode.
It can be switched to volume ID mode with the option \fB\-i\fR or
\fB\-\-volume\-id\fR.
.PP
If \fINEW\fR is omitted, then the existing label or volume ID is written to the
standard output.
A label can't be longer than 11 bytes and should be in all upper case for best
compatibility.
An empty string or a label consisting only of white space is not allowed.
A volume ID must be given as a hexadecimal number (no leading "0x" or
similar) and must fit into 32 bits.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-volume\-id\fR" 4
Switch to volume ID mode.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reset\fR" 4
Remove label in label mode or generate new ID in volume ID mode.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
Display a help message and terminate.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4
Show version number and terminate.

.SH COMPATIBILITY and BUGS
For historic reasons FAT label is stored in two different locations: in the boot
sector and as a special volume label entry in the root directory. MS-DOS 5.00,
MS-DOS 6.22, MS-DOS 7.10, Windows 98, Windows XP and also Windows 10 read FAT
label only from the root directory. Absence of the volume label in the root
directory is interpreted as empty or none label, even if boot sector contains
some valid label.

When Windows XP or Windows 10 system changes a FAT label it stores it only in
the root directory -- letting boot sector unchanged. Which leads to problems
when a label is removed on Windows. Old label is still stored in the boot sector
but removed from the root directory.

\fBdosfslabel\fR prior to the version 3.0.7 operated only with FAT labels stored
in the boot sector, completely ignoring a volume label in the root directory.

\fBdosfslabel\fR in versions 3.0.7 - 3.0.15 reads FAT labels from the root
directory and in case of absence, it fallbacks to a label stored in the boot
sector. Change operation resulted in updating a label in the boot sector and
\fIsometimes\fR also in the root directory due to the bug. That bug was fixed in
\fBdosfslabel\fR version 3.0.16 and since this version \fBdosfslabel\fR updates
label in both location.

Since version 4.2, \fBfatlabel\fR reads a FAT label only from the root directory
(like MS-DOS and Windows systems), but changes a FAT label in both locations. In
version 4.2 was fixed handling of empty labels and labels which starts with a
byte 0xE5.

It is strongly suggested to not use \fBdosfslabel\fR prior to version 3.0.16.
