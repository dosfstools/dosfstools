.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmkfs.fat\fP is used to create an MS\-DOS filesystem under Linux on a device
(usually a disk partition).  \fIdevice\fP is the special file corresponding to
the device (e.g /dev/hdXX).  \fIblock\-count\fP is the number of blocks on the
device.  If omitted, \fBmkfs.fat\fP automatically determines the filesystem
size.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
\fB\-a\fP
Normally, for any filesystem except very small ones, \fBmkfs.fat\fP will align
all the data structures to cluster size, to make sure that as long as the
partition is properly aligned, so will all the data structures in the
filesystem.  This option disables alignment; this may provide a handful of
additional clusters of storage at the expense of a significant performance
degradation on RAIDs, flash media or large\-sector hard disks.
.TP 
\fB\-A\fP
Use Atari variation of the MS\-DOS filesystem. This is default if \fBmkfs.fat\fP
is run on an Atari, then this option turns off Atari format. There are some
differences when using Atari format: If not directed otherwise by the user,
\fBmkfs.fat\fP will always use 2 sectors per cluster, since GEMDOS doesn't like
other values very much.  It will also obey the maximum number of sectors
GEMDOS can handle.  Larger filesystems are managed by raising the logical
sector size.  Under Atari format, an Atari\-compatible serial number for the
filesystem is generated, and a 12 bit FAT is used only for filesystems that
have one of the usual floppy sizes (720k, 1.2M, 1.44M, 2.88M), a 16 bit FAT
otherwise. This can be overridden with the \fB\-F\fP option. Some PC\-specific
boot sector fields aren't written, and a boot message (option \fB\-m\fP) is
ignored.
.TP 
\fB\-b\fP\fI sector\-of\-backup \fP
Selects the location of the backup boot sector for FAT32. Default depends on
number of reserved sectors, but usually is sector 6. The backup must be
within the range of reserved sectors.
.TP 
\fB\-c\fP
Check the device for bad blocks before creating the filesystem.
.TP 
\fB\-C\fP
Create the file given as \fIdevice\fP on the command line, and write the
to\-be\-created filesystem to it. This can be used to create the new
filesystem in a file instead of on a real device, and to avoid using \fBdd\fP
in advance to create a file of appropriate size. With this option, the
\fIblock\-count\fP must be given, because otherwise the intended size of the
filesystem wouldn't be known. The file created is a sparse file, which
actually only contains the meta\-data areas (boot sector, FATs, and root
directory). The data portions won't be stored on the disk, but the file
nevertheless will have the correct size. The resulting file can be copied
later to a floppy disk or other device, or mounted through a loop device.
.TP 
\fB\-D\fP\fI drive\-number\fP
Specify the BIOS drive number to be stored in the FAT boot sector.  This
value is usually 0x80 for hard disks and 0x00 for floppy devices or
partitions to be used for floppy emulation.
.TP 
\fB\-f\fP\fI number\-of\-FATs\fP
Specify the number of file allocation tables in the filesystem.  The default
is 2.  Currently the Linux MS\-DOS filesystem does not support more than 2
FATs.
.TP 
\fB\-F\fP\fI FAT\-size\fP
Specifies the type of file allocation tables used (12, 16 or 32 bit).  If
nothing is specified, \fBmkfs.fat\fP will automatically select between 12, 16
and 32 bit, whatever fits better for the filesystem size.
.TP 
\fB\-h\fP\fI number\-of\-hidden\-sectors \fP
Select the number of hidden sectors in the volume. Apparently some digital
cameras get indigestion if you feed them a CF card without such hidden
sectors, this option allows you to satisfy them.
.TP 
\fI\-i  volume\-id\fP
Sets the volume ID of the newly created filesystem; \fIvolume\-id\fP is a 32\-bit
hexadecimal number (for example, 2e24ec82).  The default is a number which
depends on the filesystem creation time.
.TP 
\fB\-I\fP
It is typical for fixed disk devices to be partitioned so, by default, you
are not permitted to create a filesystem across the entire device.
\fBmkfs.fat\fP will complain and tell you that it refuses to work.  This is
different when using MO disks.  One doesn't always need partitions on MO
disks.  The filesystem can go directly to the whole disk.  Under other OSes
this is known as the 'superfloppy' format.

This switch will force \fBmkfs.fat\fP to work properly.
.TP 
\fB\-l\fP\fI filename\fP
Read the bad blocks list from \fIfilename\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-m\fP\fI message\-file\fP
Sets the message the user receives on attempts to boot this filesystem
without having properly installed an operating system.  The message file
must not exceed 418 bytes once line feeds have been converted to carriage
return\-line feed combinations, and tabs have been expanded.  If the filename
is a hyphen (\-), the text is taken from standard input.
.TP 
\fB\-M\fP\fI FAT\-media\-type\fP
Specify the media type to be stored in the FAT boot sector.  This value is
usually 0xF8 for hard disks and has a value from 0xF9 to 0xFF for floppies
or partitions to be used for floppy emulation.
.TP 
\fB\-n\fP\fI volume\-name\fP
Sets the volume name (label) of the filesystem.  The volume name can be up
to 11 characters long.  The default is no label.
.TP 
\fB\-r\fP\fI root\-dir\-entries\fP
Select the number of entries available in the root directory.  The default
is 112 or 224 for floppies and 512 for hard disks.
.TP 
\fB\-R\fP\fI number\-of\-reserved\-sectors \fP
Select the number of reserved sectors. With FAT32 format at least 2 reserved
sectors are needed, the default is 32. Otherwise the default is 1 (only the
boot sector).
.TP 
\fB\-s\fP\fI sectors\-per\-cluster\fP
Specify the number of disk sectors per cluster.  Must be a power of 2,
i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, ... 128.
.TP 
\fB\-S\fP\fI logical\-sector\-size\fP
Specify the number of bytes per logical sector.  Must be a power of 2 and
greater than or equal to 512, i.e. 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, or
32768.
.TP 
\fB\-v\fP
Verbose execution.
.SH BUGS
\fBmkfs.fat\fP can not create boot\-able filesystems. This isn't as easy as you
might think at first glance for various reasons and has been discussed a lot
already.  \fBmkfs.fat\fP simply will not support it ;)
